The program I have developed leverages the ImageNet dataset and the ResNet-18 model. ImageNet is used to view the live video feed and train the images, while ResNet-18 serves as the foundational architecture for the AI program. After collecting and training the dataset, the program proceeds to classify the images from the live video feed. Torch and torchvision are employed for training the ResNet-18 model, and the live video feed is used to run the ImageNet program and classify utensils in real-time.
